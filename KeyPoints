"""
In python we can declare a variable without data type which is  
[a = 10 repsesents int]
[b = "I am string" represents string]
[c = true represents bool] like wise the variavles are declared without datatype

We can't concatinate the string with any other datatypes.
If we have to combine it have to typecast the respective datatype to string

We can check the max and min values directly like print(max(12,33,432,4323,645333)) same as for min value too,
and math.sqrt and so on.
For this we need to add "import math".

In while loop have use braces instead of fullstop incase of finding length.....
