1#WHILE LOOP = Executes the block of code until the condition is true

# Must follow the INDENTATIONS

#you can't assign  a vairable without declaring it
# name = ""

# while  len(name) == 0: # here params are important
#      name = input("Enter your name: ")

#      print("Hey " + name)



2# FOR LOOP = It executes the code limited number of times whereas whileloop executes unlimited number of times

#Here range is used only for integers not for strings
# for i in range(10):
#     print("Hii I am from range 10")
#     print(i)

# for q in range(30,50,3):#here 30 is starting point and it is includes and 50 is ending point and it is excludes
#     print("Hii I am from range 30 to 50")# and 3 creates a difference between each number 
#     print(q)       
# print("Hii I am from String")
# for i in ("Manoj Mama"):
#     {
#         print(i)   
#     }



3# NESTED LOOPS      Indentations are important

# rows = int(input("Enter number of rows want to print "))
# columns = int(input("Enter number of columns want to print "))
# symbol = input("Enter a symbol to use ")

# for q in range(rows):
#     for i in range(columns):
#         print(symbol,end="") #here end="" used for not to print new line
        
#     print()



4#LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS

#Break=used to terminate the loop entirely ,Pass=acts as a p;aceholder ,Continue=skips to the next iteration for the loop

# while True:
#     car = input("Enter a car name ")
#     if car != "":
#         pass



5#



# while True:

temp = int(input("Enter the current temperature "))
if the in temp:
   print("Yees")
# if temp > 35 :
#  print("It is too hot")
# elif temp < 0 or temp < 35 :
#  print("Its too cool better stay indoores")
# elif temp == "":
#  print("Please enter a value")

    # break
